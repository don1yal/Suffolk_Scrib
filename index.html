                    <p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted (sorry, I’m still working hard on my next book) and hadn’t planned to post but this piece<br>
                       from Terry on Rosie’s blog deserves to be spread far and wide.<br>
                        If you are an author and you ask someone for their honest opinion of your work, don’t get upset if they give it. Book bloggers <br>
                        are treasures. They should be encouraged, praised, and if possible given red wine and chocolates. These wonderful people <br>
                        give up their time, for free, to review books. And as every book is a piece of art, whether they like it or not is subjective (if you <br>
                        don’t believe me, look up the one-star reviews on your favourite book).
                        A well-thought out review is a gift, whether positive or negative, and if you don’t think you can react well to somebody not <br>
                        liking your book, then you should think long and hard about publishing it at all.

                    <p>… me!</p>
                    <p>I have to admit, I was a little dubious about NaNoWriMo before starting. Yes, I saw the value of creating a community of like- <br>
                        minded individuals all focussing on one goal, but at the same time 1667 words a day, while not a huge amount on a single <br> 
                        day, is a lot of writing day in, day out, for a month.</p>
                    <p>From a personal point of view, the month of November wasn’t exactly quiet. Along with work and being there for my family,<br>
                        I’d also recently taken on learning a set of songs for a duet, there was my oldest son’s tenth birthday split over two weekends <br>
                        (as the birthday fell on a Wednesday) and I had committed to starting a cricket coaching course at the end of the month, <br>
                        ruling out more weekend writing time.</p>
                    <p>Yet in the end, I did it and with more than a week to spare!</p>
                    <p>So what have I learned?</p> 
                    <h3>1 Having a deadline really spurs you on</h3>
                    <p>I know I work well to deadlines with my job but this was the first self-imposed deadline I’ve had for my writing and it really <br>
                       drove me on. By committing publicly to delivering something I found I was planning my days better, snatching the odd 30 <br>
                       minutes writing time when I could instead of sitting in front of the box, and generally doing all I could – without upsetting <br>
                       my family – to hit my goal.</p>   
                    <h3>2 I can write faster than I thought</h3>   
                    <p>When writing my first three novels, on a good day i could hit between 2000 to 2500 words. My best was just over 3000 words, <br>
                         yet there were a number of times during the past month where I wrote well over 4000 words in a day. This may have had <br>
                         something to do with the story itself, having a clear target or just generally being more focussed, but when writing in the <br>
                         future my expectations of what’s achievable has changed.</p>
                    <h3>3 Not stopping to edit works</h3>
                    <p>I’ve always been a believer of not looking back when writing your first draft but this year I took it a step further than I’ve <br>
                       done in the past. Where I used to correct the odd sentence or paragraph I was which I was particularly unhappy, for <br>
                        NaNoWriMo I just left comments in red all over my MS on areas I felt needed work or where I had a change of plan, but then <br>
                        carried on going. While this was a great help to hit the word count, it will be interesting to see how the first rewrite goes!</p>
                    <h3>4 The joy of overwriting</h3>
                    <p>One of my favourite discoveries during NaNoWriMo was how much fun over-writing is. What do I mean by this? In my case it <br>
                       was allowing myself to describe settings or characters in more detail than was needed, or to write far too much exposition than <br>
                       would be in the final book. This is a big change for me. I usually write sparingly and go back to add further detail later, but this <br>
                       time <br>
                       around over-writing really helped me get under the skin of the world and the story I created. I know a lot of what I’ve written will <br>
                       be (rightly) cut during the edit but it has been fun letting myself go a allowing myself time to explore the people and settings I’ve <br>
                       created.</p>   
                    <h3>5 I’ve been introduced to even more lovely writers</h3> 
                    <p>I’ve always maintained that one of the best things about writing is the supportive community, and through NaNoWriMo I’ve <br>
                       got to meet a lot of new supportive and encouraging writers. Sadly I haven’t been able to go to any meet ups but the response <br>
                       on the NaNoWriMo regional message board has been really positive. Next year I’ll definitely attend.</p>  
                    <p>Of course, my first draft isn’t finished. I’m not sure whether I’ll hit my extended goal of finishing it by the end of the month <br>
                       but it will be really close and I can’t wait to then get my teeth into it and start editing in the new year.</p>
                    <p>So what about you? If you’ve taken part in NaNoWriMo this year, what has been your experience? If you haven’t, have I <br>
                       persuaded you to do it next year? I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

                <a href=""><img src="assets/bluelogo.webp" alt="" class="img"></a>
                <p>As you can probably tell with the lack of posts and minimal comments on other blogs or social media platforms, I am <br>
                still thoroughly engrossed in NaNoWriMo 2016. The good news is that I’m still flying. I don’t know whether it is the book idea or <br>
                whether it is the fixed goal of 50K words in a month, but on my full writing days I’m achieving between 3000 and 4000 <br>
                words a day, even on days where I feel I’m trying to chisel each word out of rock one at a time. This compares to 2000 on <br>
                a good day when writing my previous novels. If there’s only one thing I take away from this process, it’s that I can write a lot <br>
                faster than I originally thought.</p>
                <p>The story itself is progressing nicely. I’m still in love with my main characters, the world is filling out nicely and there haven’t <br>
                been too many deviations from plan. I do know, however, that there will be a lot of work to do during the edit.</p>
                <p>Also, the story went through a dark phase last week – a prime example of art reflecting life. I found myself rewriting sections <br>
                because this is a book aimed at older children, and while there’s nothing wrong with scaring children a little bit – look at <br>
                Roald Dahl’s stories for example – I don’t want to traumatise them. That said, I’ve now come out the other side – at least in <br>
                my writing – and I’m still on course to beat the 50000 words by the end of November. In fact, as you can see there is a good <br>
                chance I’ll pass that mark next week!</p>
                <img src="assets/screen.png" alt="screen" width="800px">
                <p>This then leads me on to my next challenge. I’ve estimated that the whole of this draft will be around 65,000 words, so my <br>
                new target is to try to finish the full draft by the end of the month. This is going to be tight as my weekends are fairly booked <br>
                up between now and then, but it’s good to keep on pushing.</p>
                <p>So how are the rest of you getting on? I’d love to hear from you</p>

                <p>I just thought I’d give you a quick update on how NaNoWriMo is going. I’m pleased to say I’m well ahead of schedule, which is <br>
                good as I won’t have the chance to write much over the next couple of days. The story is flying. As it’s a completely new world <br>
                for me I’m finding I’m over-writing – long descriptive passages, far too much detail – but this is helping me get a real feel for <br>
                the world I’m creating and can be pruned hard during the edit.</p>
                <img src="assets/screen.png" alt="screen" width="800px">
                <p>As a plotter I’m finding the story is roughly going ahead as planned. That said, I’ve already changed the main occupation of <br>
                my lead character, introduced characters who had just appeared out of nothing and created two religions, all of which may <br>
                not make the final cut. As you might guess, I’m having an absolute blast pulling everything together.*</p>
                <p>So how are the rest of my fellow NaNoWriMo writers getting on? Are you on track or are you struggling? I’d love to hear from you.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>*Remind me of this during the next update if I complain about how difficult this NaNoWriMo malarkey is!</p>

               </p>
            </div>
               <div class="media-text">
                <a href=""><img src="assets/bluelogo.webp" alt="" class="img"></a>
                <p>It’s that time of year when writers across the world get ready for the largest writing event of the year, NaNoWriMo, and this <br> 
                year I’ve decided to joe one of them.</p>
                <p>For those of you who aren’t aware, NaNoWriMo is National Novel Writing Month, where from the 1st November participants <br>
                 begin writing the first draft of a new novel. The goal is to complete 50,000 words by midnight on the 30th November – an <br>
                 average of 1,666 words per day.The event started in 1999 with just twenty-one participants but has grown year-on-year to <br>
                hit 431,626 participants in 2015.</p>
                <p>I’ve always wanted to take part in NaNoWriMo but so far the timing has never been right. This year, however, the timing <br>
                 couldn’t be better. I’ve been working on the idea for a children’s novel over the past couple of months as I’d love to have a <br>
                 book published that my two boys can read. Asthose who follow my blog regularly know, I’m <br>
                  half-plotter, half-pantser, so I’m as prepared as I like to be with a good idea of the <br>
                 who the main characters are and their motivations, a general <br> 
                idea of the world I’m creating, and an outline of what happens where – without being too prescriptive. I’ve also researched the relevant <br>
                 historical era I’m loosely basing the story around and I’ve already written a first chapter – which will need re-writing – so I <br>
                 have a good feel for the style I’m looking to achieve.</p>
                <p>Still, <strong>one thousand, six hundred and sixty-six words per day</strong> is no small undertaking. The most I’ve written in one day is <br>
                 4000 words but that was a one-off, took all day and my brain was mush by the end of it. Finding the time to write over one <br>
                  and a half thousand words each and every day will be tough, and if that wasn’t hard enough, I’m also starting my cricket <br>
                 coaching qualificationslater the same month, so time will be even tighter – and that’s not even mentioning family, work, <br>
                music and so on. But, it’s good to challenge yourself every now and then, right?</p>
                <p>The most important thing to remember about NaNoWriMo is that it is a bit of a misnomer. By the end of the process you <br>
                 won’t have a finished novel. Unless you are writing children’s fiction (as I am) you may not even have a completed first draft,<br>
                 but you will have completed the bulk of the writing AND got yourself into the habit of writing regularly, one of the biggest <br>
                obstacles to completing a novel.</p>
                <p><strong>So the big question is – who’s joining me?</strong></p>

           <p>REEDSY – THE ONE-STOP SHOP FOR WRITERS?
           </p>
        </div>
           <div class="media-text">
            <a href=""><img src="assets/s.webp" alt="" class="img"></a>
              <p>About eighteen months ago I wrote a post about a new startup, Reedsy, who were looking to develop a marketplace to bring <br>
                authors and publishers together with the best editing, cover design and book marketing professionals. At the time I thought <br>
                it was an intriguing idea, as indie authors were realising that for their books to be taken seriously they needed to be well-written, well- <br>
                edited and have a professional cover but it was difficult to know where to find the best possible support. At the <br>
                same time, I was concerned that this was yet another service looking to earn income from authors (and publishing <br>
                professionals) without delivering any real value in return.</p>
                <p>Since my last post, Reedsy has grown, developing it’s services and website, so I thought it was time to revisit what they offer.</p>
                <p>Full disclosure: Ricardo Fayet, one of the founders of Reedsy, has read and given great reviews of my books. This has no impact <br>
                on this post and I have never been requested to write anything about Reedsy. I also have not used the Reedsy marketplace to find <br>
                a publishing professional but my editor offers his services via Reedsy.</p>
                <h3>What’s new?</h3>
                <p>Where the old Reedsy was pretty much the market place, allowing authors to search for marketing professionals <br>
                and professionals to promote themselves, Reedsy now offer a lot more.</p>
                <h4>Learning</h4>
                <p>They have a series of free Live Videos where industry experts talk about specific topic (e.g. cover critiques, how to go about <br>
                your second draft), all of which are really useful for a novice or experienced writer. They also offer a series of free courses on <br>
                topics as diverse as how to build your writing routine to getting the most from Amazon’s algorithms. The best thing about <br>
                these services are that you don’t have to be registered with Reedsy to take part (although the courses are via email so you do <br>
                have to give you name and email address). Even if you don’t use any of Reedsy’s other services, these are well worth having a look at.</p>
                <h4>Book editor</h4>
                <p>Reedsy have also created a book editor, free software for you to use to write your novel. Because it is online, you can use it to <br>
                collaborate with your editor and once complete it can create the final ebook or POD file for you. My thoughts on this are <br>
                mixed. In function it is very similar to Scrivener – which I love – and the fact it is free makes it very attractive. However I <br>
                have two concerns. First, by using this service you are tying yourself to Reedsy in the same way some of us are tied over time <br>
                to Google or Apple products. I’d want to know how to access my files if I change my mind. Second is around the files <br>
                themselves. Where are they stored? Who owns them? What happens if Reedsy goes bust? It’s not clear from the promotional <br>
                page and I would want clear answers on these points if I was ever to think about using the service.</p>
                <h4>The market place</h4>
                <p>The market place has developed since I last looked from being predominantly editors and cover designers to now promoting <br>
                PR, Marketing and Ghostwriting services as well. You can filter your search by the type of service offered and the genre they <br>
                specialise in to help find the right person for you. What is noticeable is that there hasn’t been a significant rise is the number <br>
                of professionals offering their services. For me, this is a good thing. It shows that Reedsy aren’t just trying to pull in numbers <br>
                to make a quick buck but are</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>One thing that’s knew is you can see the response rate of the professional, so you know whether your enquiry will be looked <br>
                at or not. It’s a nice addition but I’d still like to have some form of rating or feedback where verified users of the service can <br>
                give feedback of their experience. I would also like to have some indication of an indicative price range as it’s difficult to tell <br>
                initially whether you would be wasting your (and the service provider’s) time with an enquiry.</p>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>As an author, I like what Reedsy are doing and the way they are approaching the market. They appear to be in it for the long <br>
                haul and are choosing quality over quantity, and are building up a portfolio of services to support authors and offer real <br>
                value. While I don’t think their offer is perfect, if they continue in this manner they could soon become the one-stop shop for <br>
                authors they’re aiming to be.</p>
                <p>At the very least, I would recommend anyone interested in writing to check out their learning videos and courses, whether <br>
                you are starting out and looking to develop your craft, or if you are an experienced writer looking to learn move about the <br>
                intricacies of the trad or indie publishing scene. They cover a wide variety of topics and are delivered by market experts. <br>
                Also, they’re free, so what do you have to lose?</p>
                <p>On a personal level I’m lucky that I already have an editor and cover designer I enjoy working with, but if I was ever looking <br>
                for a professional service, I would definitely look on Reedsy on top of my other searches.</p>
                <p>What about you? Have you used Reedsy at all? Do you have any feedback you would like to share with us? I would love to hear <br>
                from you.</p>
